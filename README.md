An open source HTML5-frontend frame that is very extensible. It is based on
HTML5 web components and is split in four distinct parts:

* Plugins: Plugins can hook into various parts of the app (and other apps too).
* Services: Back-end service in Node, discovered as node modules in service folder.
* Themes: Themes can be installed into the app into the  client/themes folder which then can be discovered by the app

The goal is to create a framework like CakePHP but for pure front-end work.

It was built internal apps within Buddhalow company but we also want to share it.

Work in progress
